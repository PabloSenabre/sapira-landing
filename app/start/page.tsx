 * Start Page - "El Despertar" Experience
 * 
 * An immersive ritual of initiation where the user:
 * 1. Awakens a dormant universe with their presence
 * 2. Discovers two living paths that respond to them
 * 3. Chooses their journey through meaningful interaction
 * 
 * Two paths:
 * - Organic (Warm) - Book a call, dialogue, human connection
 * - Geometric (Cool) - Start building, action, creation
